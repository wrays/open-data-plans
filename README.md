# City of Austin Open Data Plans

## about this repo

This repo is the central collaboration hub for managing Open Data Plans for departments at the City of Austin. It hosts the content of each plan, tracks to-do list items, and explains how the plans work.

To keep the plans updated and accessible, we do the following:

1. Write and update the information in the plans
2. Perform technical work to keep the plans website functioning 
3. Teach people how to help us do these two things


## current projects

## for developers

The Open Data Plans site is written in reStructured text markup and converted to HTML by a documentation generator called [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html).

The HTML generated by Sphinx is served by [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/). Readthedocs.org watches the `master` branch of this repo. When changes are detected, readthedocs.org will  re-build the open data plans using Sphinx and publish the updated site to http://open-data-plans.readthedocs.io

More details and step by step instructions for forking this repo and developing locally using Sphinx will be added to the wiki, hopefully sooner rather than later.
