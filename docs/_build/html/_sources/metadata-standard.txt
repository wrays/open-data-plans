Purpose of this document
=============================

This document explains how to use metadata to describe open data assets held by the City of Austin. By using a common and consistent metadata vocabulary across City departments, we can make it easier for people to discover and use City information. 

About the metadata standard
==============================

When would someone use these metadata standards?
---------------------------------------------------

- An open data liaison publishing a new resource to the City's open data portal
- A City web developer wanting to make a department's open data offerings more discoverable by search engines
- A member of the public looking for a dataset to use in a project

What does the metadata standard contain?
---------------------------------------------------

- A list of descriptors (metadata elements) that should be provided whenever a dataset is published on the open data portal
- Description of when to use the metadata elements
- Details about how to use each element correctly

Design principles
----------------------------------------------------

- Be interoperable with existing standards such as those developed by the Federal Government and popular web search engines
- Start small and increase the number of elements over time
- Develop openly and in close collaboration with end users

When to use these metadata elements:
====================================================

Required
----------------
Use of the standard metadata elements is required when publishing any dataset to the open data portal. The metadata values should also be included in the open data inventory. 
> An open dataset is a table, map, or any other resource that is published to the open data portal.

Optional
----------------
Any time a public dataset is shared internally or publically, it is beneficial to include these metadata elements in a note or accessory file that accompanies the share. All City of Austin staff and partners are welcome to use this standard.
